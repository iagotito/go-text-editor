# Go Text Editor

> Yeah, very creative.

Text editor created following the logic of the Youtube series made by
[Monkey see, monkey do](https://www.youtube.com/@monkey_see_monkey_do):
[Programming a Text Editor in
Go](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLfIBXQeu3aa0NI4RT5OuRQsLo6gtLwGN).

Original repo: [EGO - A bare bones text editor written in
Go](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/ego)

But instead of use [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go)
library (that is not maintained anymore) , I'll use
[tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) (v2).

My goal here is to learn the logic and how to manipulate the terminal
to create another project later.
